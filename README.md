# HEART-STROKE-PREDICTION-SYSTEM
Heart stroke is a leading cause of death, and early prediction is crucial for prevention. This project utilizes the Random Forest algorithm to assess stroke risk based on key health factors such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol and smoking habits.
This project leverages machine learning, specifically the Random Forest algorithm, to predict heart strokes by analyzing patient data such as vital signs, medical history, and lifestyle factors, enabling accurate and timely detection.
Random Forest is selected for its high accuracy, ability to handle large datasets, and resistance to overfitting, making it ideal for robust healthcare data analysis.
The model aims to provide reliable stroke risk predictions, assisting healthcare professionals in identifying at-risk individuals, reducing mortality, and enhancing preventive care.
